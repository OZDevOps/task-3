Start hadoop instance via Vagrant and AWS ec2

I have no enough memory to test Hadoop, so start them on AWS directly.

### install AWS plug-in in Vagrant

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws


### install hostmanager plugin
 
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager

### check the instance status and start them with `vagrant up`

    vagrant status
